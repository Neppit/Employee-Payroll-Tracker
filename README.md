## Deployment

## Usage

To use this webpage, you first need to click on the "Add Employees" button at the bottom of the table. It will then prompt the user to insert all of the relevant employee data they intend to track, and will then repeat this process for each employee they add. Afterwards, the information will all be displayed on a table for them. For additional information, the user can use the Inspect feature of their browser to open the console, where they can then see the employees average salaries and a random employee drawing.
